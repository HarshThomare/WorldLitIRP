                  I often get asked this question; why do I not stay home. The real answer is I love the adventure. When I first sailed to Lilliput, I was fascinated by them. They were a weird group. They were four inches tall and were in a petty fight with the blefuscudians. This made me think of other opportunities that are out in the world, maybe, I might gain wealth or something interesting from going there. I am planning to leave soon with a friend to Surat. I hope we have a safe journey.

                  Treasure that was what I was going after, but that was not all. I wanted to prove to my mother that I was of age. Doctor Livesey and his squire accompanied me on the journey and helped me get a ship. After a couple of months on the ship, tension among the crew arose. There was constant drinking and fistfights. The day we reached the island, the crew decided to commit mutiny. I was along with the mutineers when they left for the Island. My goal was to spy on the crew and relay the information to the Doctor. After the second boat with the doctor arrived on the island, I told them about what I heard. I was in shock that they know about such an event and did nothing about it. This also concerns me that people would do anything for money. Near the end of our voyage, the same thing occurred again;  Long John Silver decided to steal the loot and flee the ship after we graciously allowed him to sail back with us. Some people never change.
